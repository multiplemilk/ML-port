    "<p>Reinforcement learning is a machine learning paradigm focused on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. It draws inspiration from behavioral psychology, where agents learn by interacting with their surroundings. The agent learns through trial and error, exploring different actions and observing the outcomes in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal is to develop a policy, which is a strategy for selecting actions based on the agent's current state, that optimally balances exploration and exploitation to achieve long-term objectives. Reinforcement learning has applications in various fields, including robotics, game playing, autonomous systems, recommendation systems, and more, where decision-making involves navigating complex and dynamic environments.</p>\n",
